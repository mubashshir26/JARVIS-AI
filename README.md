News Updates: Fetch the latest news headlines from India using the NewsAPI.
Polished GUI: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter, featuring text and voice input options.
Voice Interaction: Interact with Jarvis using voice commands for a seamless experience.

Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
SpeechRecognition: For voice input processing.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
Requests: For fetching news via the NewsAPI.
webbrowser: For opening websites and playing music on YouTube.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Jarvis-AI-Assistant.git
cd Jarvis-AI-Assistant


Install Dependencies:Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have requirements.txt, install the following manually:
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 PyAudio requests


Set Up the Music Library:Ensure the musiclibrary.py file exists in the project directory with a dictionary of songs and their YouTube links. Example:
music = {
    "jhol": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2RAq5o5pwc&list=RD-2RAq5o5pwc&start_radio=1",
    "fakira": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJuoi13hbBc",
    "mere mehboob qayamat hogi": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Ul3ASaFLU"
}


Set Up NewsAPI Key:

Obtain an API key from NewsAPI.
Store the API key securely in a .env file in the project directory:NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here


Note: The current code uses a hardcoded API key for simplicity. For production, modify the code to load the key from the .env file using a library like python-dotenv:pip install python-dotenv

Then, in jarvis_with_gui.py:from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
newsapi = os.getenv("NEWS_API_KEY")




Run the Application:
python jarvis_with_gui.py



Usage

Launch the App: Run the script, and a GUI window will open with the title "Jarvis AI Assistant".
Text Commands: Type commands in the input box and press "Send" or hit Enter.
Examples: open google, play jhol, news


Voice Commands: Click the "Speak to Jarvis" button and speak your command.
Examples: Say "open youtube", "play fakira", or "news".


Exit: Type or say "exit" to close the application.
